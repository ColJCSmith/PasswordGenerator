# PasswordGenerator

Concept:
Cybersecurity is now a board level priority, thanks to increasing digitisation and reliance on technology due to COVID-19.
Despite record investments in this space, systems are still not secure, and the most common point of failure is still useres themselves.
Password Generator takes the risk out of the process of choosing a password.  By generating a completely random string of characters, users are protected from the most common mistakes.
Different systems have different requirements, so Password Generator allows users to choose the nubers of chanracters, upper and lower cases, numerals and characters.
